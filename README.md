### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Postdoc in the Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering, Mathematics, and Physical Science at the University of Exeter. 
I have strong interests in these topics, including time series forecasting, financial data analysis, probablistic machine learning, Bayesian non-parametric predictive models and their applications, e.g. Gaussian Process and its application.
Welcome to contact me if you would like to collaborate with me on these topics above.
